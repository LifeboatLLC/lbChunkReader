 You can build the executable using the Makefile.

 You will have to set the following envirnoment variables:
       HDF5_DIR set to your HDF5 Path (this will probably end in a version number)
       HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR set to your HDF5 include directory path (this will probably end in include)
       HDF5_LIBRARIES set to your HDF5 lib directory path (this will probably end in lib)

  When you run the program, LD_LIBRARY_PATH should include the HDF5 lib directory.
